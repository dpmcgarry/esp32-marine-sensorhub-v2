# Instructions for Claude

## General / Git

- IMPORTANT: Never commit changes unless I tell you explicitly to do so
- Don't create additional markdown files unless I tell you to do so
- The initial design document is Hardware.md and the hardware requirements are captured in Requirements.md


## Hardware Implementation

- There is a kicad project in the hardware directory. All the physical / hardware design should be captured in that kicad project
