# Instructions for Claude

## General / Git

- IMPORTANT: Never commit changes unless I tell you explicitly to do so
- Don't create additional markdown files unless I tell you to do so
- The initial design document is Hardware.md and the hardware requirements
  are captured in Requirements.md
- Write commit messages using the conventional commit specification:
  <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification>
- Never use the word comprehensive
- When you write documentation scrub any weasel words

## Hardware Implementation

- There is a kicad project in the hardware directory. All the physical and
  hardware design should be captured in that kicad project
